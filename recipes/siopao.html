        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my recipe for the the dough for the popular Filipino steamed bun with chicken and pork filling. 
            Serve hot with noodle soup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl.
                Add water and 1/4 cup oil; mix into a dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, at least 10 minutes. 
                Dust with extra flour if necessary.</li>
            <li>Warm up the oven for 1 minute. Turn oven off.</li>
            <li>Oil a large bowl; place dough inside and cover with cheesecloth. Place in the warmed oven until size has doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough. Keep in the oven until risen, at least 15 minutes more. 
            Knead dough onto a flat work surface and divide into 12 golf-sized balls. 
            Roll out each ball and fill with choice of filling (see footnote for my chicken and pork filling). Gather and twist the edges together to secure the filling.</li>
            <li>Place each siopao on a 3x3-inch piece of wax paper.</li>
            <li>Place siopao in a steamer and steam for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
