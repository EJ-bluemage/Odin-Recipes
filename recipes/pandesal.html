        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pandesal is a Filipino bread, the most popular bread in the Philippines. 
            It's often consumed for breakfast with coffee or hot chocolate.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm milk</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 (.25-ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and yeast in a large bowl;
                stir until sugar and yeast are fully dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining sugar, flour, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                Pour in milk mixture and vegetable oil. Mix until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a flat work surface. Knead until smooth. 
                Shape into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth 
                and let rise until doubled, at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 4 equal portions using a bench knife. 
                Roll each portion into a log; slice diagonally into 1-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Pour bread crumbs onto a large plate. Roll each piece of dough in bread crumbs and 
                place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let rise until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
